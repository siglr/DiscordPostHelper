# Discord Post Helper
This tool's purpose is to help its users in the publishing of Discord posts related to the creation of soaring/gliding flight plans/tasks and group flights and events.

It is a Windows forms application based on the Microsoft .NET Framework and as such, requires version 4.8 or later of that framework.
You can download the .NET Framework here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer

To install for the first time, simply create a folder anywhere on your computer and extract the files in that folder. After first installation, the application supports auto-update so shouldn't be a problem anymore.
