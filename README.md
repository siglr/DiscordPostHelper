# Discord Post Helper
This tool's purpose is to help its users in the publishing of Discord posts related to the creation of soaring/gliding flight plans/tasks and group flights and events.

It is a Windows forms application based on the Microsoft .NET Framework and as such, requires version 4.8 or later of that framework.
You can download the .NET Framework here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer

To install for the first time, simply create a folder anywhere on your computer and extract the files in that folder. After first installation, the application supports auto-update so shouldn't be a problem anymore.

*Note: Some users report that Windows Defender is detecting threats from the main executable in this tool, they seem to be false positive as running analysis with BitDefender or Kasperky online returns zero threat at all. I've submitted the file to Microsoft Security Intelligence for an in-depth analysis and will report back with the final result, but the file right now shows "no malware detected".*
